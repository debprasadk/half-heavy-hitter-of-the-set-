# half-heavy-hitter-of-the-set-
Given a set of n numbers, a strict φ-heavy hitter is defined to be a member of the set that has more than φ-fraction of occurrences, i.e., its count should be more than φ ∗ n in the set. Write a program that takes a series of numbers and can efficiently return the strict $\frac{1}{2} $ -heavy hitter of the set, if it at all exists.
